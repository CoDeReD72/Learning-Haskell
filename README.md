# Learning Haskell

Welcome to the Learning Haskell Repository! 

This repository is my personal journey to learn the Haskell programming language. Haskell is a functional programming language that is widely used in industry and academia. Functional programming is a new paradigm to me (other than brief interaction in University), and I'm excited to explore this approach to programming.
